## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/5udh33r-95/5udh33r-95.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/5udh33r-95/5udh33r-95.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### March 25 2021
Well here goes nothing. I've made journals before mostly to show other people. This time it will be for my own sake.

Objectives I wish to achieve:
1. Recognise patterns in behavior and thought that lead to low productivity or depression
2. Keep track of strategies that work and strategies that don't for each of these patterns
3. Keep track of how productive I am being and celebrate myself.

So every day I will need to record these three things. What went right. How bad or good things were (How much work did I do?). How effective were the things I tried to do to make things better. Lets start today:

Things that went well:
1. I finally finished a presentable form of my website. There were several bugs that I fixed and also included some neat-looking transitions onto the website. Personally very happy with how it looks.
2. Started journaling by identifying what exactly I wanted from this experience so it doesn't become me rambling to myself
3. Talked to Naga even if it was him who reached out to me.

Things that went wrong and how they went wrong:
1. I wanted to call up SBI, but the anxiety of talking to them made me procrastinate and I didn't do it. I kept telling myself I would do it at a later time till I basically pushed it to tomorrow. But I could've given tomorrow's Sudheer a gift. Let's not procrastinate. Let's set a time for everything I want to accomplish and accomplish it at that time.
2. Wanted to code up the gradient plot. Didn't really set a time for this. So maybe having a plan of things to accomplish everyday written down is a good idea.

Notes for tomorrow:
1. Make a plan when you get up about what to get done/ how much to work. Stick to the numbers as best you can.
