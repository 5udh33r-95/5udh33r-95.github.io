### March 25 2021
Well here goes nothing. I've made journals before mostly to show other people. This time it will be for my own sake.

Objectives I wish to achieve:
1. Recognise patterns in behavior and thought that lead to low productivity or depression
2. Keep track of strategies that work and strategies that don't for each of these patterns
3. Keep track of how productive I am being and celebrate myself.

So every day I will need to record these three things. What went right. How bad or good things were (How much work did I do?). How effective were the things I tried to do to make things better. Lets start today:

Things that went well:
1. I finally finished a presentable form of my website. There were several bugs that I fixed and also included some neat-looking transitions onto the website. Personally very happy with how it looks.
2. Started journaling by identifying what exactly I wanted from this experience so it doesn't become me rambling to myself
3. Talked to Naga even if it was him who reached out to me.

Things that went wrong and how they went wrong:
1. I wanted to call up SBI, but the anxiety of talking to them made me procrastinate and I didn't do it. I kept telling myself I would do it at a later time till I basically pushed it to tomorrow. But I could've given tomorrow's Sudheer a gift. Let's not procrastinate. Let's set a time for everything I want to accomplish and accomplish it at that time.
2. Wanted to code up the gradient plot. Didn't really set a time for this. So maybe having a plan of things to accomplish everyday written down is a good idea.

Notes for tomorrow:
1. Make a plan when you get up about what to get done/ how much to work. Stick to the numbers as best you can.

### March 26 2021
Positives:
1.Recovered most objectives for the day even if a little sloppy
2.Found one source of motivation
3.Completed finding a panel
4.Completed some preliminary work for TA work
5.Continued journaling
6.Bought food and breakfast for the week

Things that were not so hot:
1. Woke up feeling tired and hungry but with no food. Due to lack of food didn't feel motivated. Got easily distracted. Cosntantly wanted distractions as a result. 1000lb sister got me motivated enough to shop and that snowballed into a bunch of stuff
2. Didn't have quality metrics in my objectives for the day, so basically just worked to get shit done. This can be a double-edged sword.

Tomorrow's focus:
1. Try incentivising. Or come up with desirable incentives.
2. Try having quality metrics

### March 30 2021
My update from the day before didn't save :(

Positives:
1. Worked a ton, although mostly on course stuff.
2. Totally ready for tomorrow and the day after's classes.
3. Have a rough plan for the week in general and feel I might be able to handle it.

Things that were not so hot:
1. I mostly only worked on course stuff although I wanted to do a bit of coding today. I kept thinking I should plan the day out but I kept adding to my laundry list of things to do before I called it a day that I ended up not eating or even taking a shower.
2. I didn't prioritise self-care again.

Tomorrow's focus:
1. Try to have a plan of how much time you want to put into each part of your life
2. Include self-care into that plan.

### April 6th 2021
It is so hard to make and maintain a habit :(

Positives:
1. Remembered to do this. Kinda felt the necessity.
2. Finished FNT grading. Didn't take very long.
3. Watched a lot of new anime and decided what I am interested in.

Negatives:
1. Didn't accomplish any of the things I wanted to. I think I am nervous about the success rate 
2. Didn't prepare for tomorrow's DL which might affect my performance tomorrow.

Things to try tomorrow:
1. Incentives
2. Convince yourself it can be done and that you are capable of doing it. Positive thinking

### April 7th 2021
